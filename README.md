## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS


### What I learned

I learned how to toggle `.innerText` with `btnSwitchMode.addEventListener` and change text in a `span` using `.forEach`


```js

Array.from(changePrice).forEach( (item, index) => 
{
      item.innerText = tabPriceHigh[index];
}
);

```


### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.
